### How to use
Just run log4j2-scan.exe or log4j2-scan with target directory path.

Usage
```
Logpresso CVE-2021-44228 Vulnerability Scanner 1.4.0 (2021-12-15)
Usage: log4j2-scan [--fix] target_path

--fix
	Backup original file and remove JndiLookup.class from JAR recursively.
--force-fix
	Do not prompt confirmation. Don't use this option unless you know what you are doing.
--debug
	Print exception stacktrace for debugging.
--trace
	Print all directories and files while scanning.
--scan-zip
	Scan also .zip extension files. This option may slow down scanning.
--no-symlink
	Do not detect symlink as vulnerable file.
--exclude [path_prefix]
	Exclude specified paths. You can specify multiple --exclude [path_prefix] pairs
--exclude-config [file_path]
	Specify exclude path list in text file. Paths should be separated by new line. Prepend # for comment.
--all-drives
	Scan all drives on Windows
--drives c,d
	Scan specified drives on Windows. Spaces are not allowed here.
```

On Windows
```
log4j2-scan [--fix] target_path
```
On Linux
```
./log4j2-scan [--fix] target_path
```
On UNIX (AIX, Solaris, and so on)
```
java -jar logpresso-log4j2-scan-1.4.0.jar [--fix] target_path
```

If you add `--fix` option, this program will copy vulnerable original JAR file to .bak file, and create new JAR file without `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` entry. In most environments, JNDI lookup feature will not be used. However, you must use this option at your own risk. It is necessary to shutdown any running JVM process before applying patch. Start affected JVM process after fix.

If you want to automate patch job, use `--force-fix` option. With this option, this program will no longer prompt for confirmation.

`(mitigated)` tag will be displayed if `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` entry is removed from JAR file.

If you add `--trace` option, this program will print all visited directories and files. Use this option only for debugging.

On Windows:

### How it works
Run in 5 steps:
1. Find all .jar, .war, .ear, .aar files recursively.
2. Find `META-INF/maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core/pom.properties` entry from JAR file.
3. Read groupId, artifactId, and version.
4. Compare log4j2 version and print vulnerable version.
5. If --fix option is used, backup vulnerable file and patch it.
   * For example, original vulnerable.jar is copied to vulnerable.jar.bak
